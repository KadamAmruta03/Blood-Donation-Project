# 🩸 Blood Donation Campaign - Management Web Application
[Live Website](https://blooddonation-kappa.vercel.app/) | [Blood Donation GitHub](https://github.com/KadamAmruta03/Blood-Donation-Project)

Blood Donation Campaign is a modern, responsive web application designed to facilitate blood donation awareness and donor registration in Mumbai. This project serves as a bridge between potential donors and major hospitals, allowing users to register, find upcoming camps, and learn about the life-saving impact of donation. It demonstrates my skills in front-end development, form validation logic, and cloud-based data integration.

The application features a clean, professional layout with an interactive FAQ system, a dynamic registration modal, and a seamless connection to a Google Sheets backend for donor management. It is fully deployed on Vercel for live access.

## Project Overview
Blood Donation Campaign is a responsive multi-page web application built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.  
This project showcases my skills in **asynchronous programming**, **DOM manipulation**, and **UI/UX design** while simulating a real-world healthcare initiative.  



**User Interaction Flow:** - **Education & Awareness:** Users browse "Why Donate" sections featuring Myth vs. Fact tables and an interactive 4-step donation guide.  
- **Success Stories:** Users can view a grid of inspiring stories showing the real-world impact of blood donation with interactive hover effects.  
- **Find Upcoming Camps:** A dedicated directory allows users to view scheduled donation drives at 9 major Mumbai hospitals with full address and eligibility details.  
- **Donor Registration:** A smart registration form captures donor details. It includes conditional logic that displays the "Last Donation Date" field only if the user selects "Yes" for previous donations.  
- **Cloud Data Logging:** Upon submission, data is sent via the Fetch API to a Google Apps Script Web App, which logs the entry directly into a Google Sheet.  

This flow ensures a high-trust, professional experience for donors while demonstrating robust data handling.
